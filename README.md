## Project Aims:
To create a functioning chatroom API onto to which a front-end can be seamlessly implemented. The primary intention was to facilitate chatrooms containing multiple users, rather than direct messages between two users *i.e. more akin to Reddit than Facebook Messenger.* In this project, we wanted to provide all users with the capability of creating a chatroom, whilst ensuring a space was reserved for more mature topics and content, hence we facilitated implementation of age restriction into indivudal chatrooms, where required. 

### Dependencies Used:
The project was built with Maven, using Java and Spring Boot Version 3.2.3. 
We also added the following dependencies:
- **Spring Web**
- **Spring Boot DevTools**
- **PostgreSQL Driver**
- **Spring Data JPA**
